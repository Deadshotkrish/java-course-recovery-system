\# Course Recovery System (Java OOP Project)



&nbsp;Overview

The Course Recovery System is a Java-based desktop application developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system manages students who require course recovery plans based on academic eligibility.



The project demonstrates strong implementation of core OOP concepts and multi-role system architecture.



\##  Key Features



\- Multi-role login system (Student, Academic Officer, System Admin)

\- Course eligibility checking

\- Academic report generation

\- Recovery plan creation with milestones

\- PDF export functionality

\- Email notification system

\- GUI-based system using Java Swing



\## OOP Concepts Implemented



\- Encapsulation

\- Inheritance (User → Student / AcademicOfficer / SystemAdmin)

\- Polymorphism

\- Abstraction via Interfaces

\- Separation of Concerns (Models, UI, Utils, Auth layers)



\## Technologies Used



\- Java

\- Java Swing (GUI)

\- File Handling

\- OOP Design Principles



\## Project Structure



\- `models/` → Core data classes

\- `auth/` → Authentication and user management

\- `ui/` → GUI components

\- `utils/` → Helper services (PDF, Email, Reports)



\## How To Run



1\. Clone repository

2\. Open in NetBeans / IntelliJ
